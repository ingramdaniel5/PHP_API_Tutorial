# PHP_API_Tutorial
This is a practice repo with a simple php api setup for practice for my group
Hey team!

Just a reminder, things youll need to run this 

XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
A text editor (I like atom and vscode but take your pic)
Postman: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en
A browser (Big google chrome guy)
sourcetree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

To edit the code just open the folder up with your preffered text editor and youre good to go!

To run the code and see it in action:
1. Start up the xampp control panel program
2. Under the actions column, press "Start" to start up the local apache server emulator
3. Place the server code in the \xampp\htdocs folder in a new folder
4. go to your browser and type in http://localhost/<insert name of folder here>
5. This will run the php code and show the output
6. To update the code just change any of the files, HIT SAVE (ctrl+s), then refresh the web page
